        <p>Hello Internet! My name is Emily and I’m a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant (ETA) in Vietnam. I’m currently teaching at Vĩnh Phúc Gifted High School in Vĩnh Yên, Vietnam, which is in the north of Vietnam about an hour and a half from Hanoi. I’ve been pretty hesitant about this whole blogging thing, but I decided to start for two main reasons. First, I’ve been pretty bad about keeping all my family and friends updated about my life, and I figured instead of repeating the same stories to 10 different group chats every day, it probably makes more sense to write it all out here to keep everyone in the loop. And second, when I was applying to Fulbright in Vietnam, I remember having such a hard time finding any information online. There were so few blogs about the Vietnam ETA position, and I still had no idea what to expect once I received the grant. So if you’re thinking of applying for the grant or doing something similar, this first post is for you. I hope I can give you an idea of what my life is like here in Vietnam so you can picture something similar for yourself!</p>

        <p class='blogsubtitle'>Why Vietnam?</p>

        <p>Something my friends, family, teachers, students, and strangers I meet in cafes in Vietnam ask me constantly is this: why Vietnam? This is a really hard question to answer because to me, it’s the most obvious thing in the world: Vietnam is an incredible country! I came here 3 years ago for a few weeks as a tourist while traveling around Southeast Asia and I was captivated by the country, but I knew I’d only had a very surface-level exposure to it. I stayed in hostels in the backpacker districts of the country, I ate at touristy restaurants, and I hardly spoke to locals who weren’t working in the hospitality industry. I wanted to come back and make some real connections with the people here, by integrating myself into a community and living the daily life of a person in Vietnam. There are a lot of tangible reasons I wanted to live in Vietnam. The country is growing economically, and it’s becoming a technological and economic powerhouse in Southeast Asia. As someone who’s interested in technology, business, and culture, this checks a lot of boxes. It has an incredibly young population, so the country is changing constantly with the new generation. Vietnam has an amazing history of resilience after basically constant occupation: after generations of Chinese rule, then French colonization, then war with the US, the new Vietnam has only existed for a few decades and is thriving more each day. And of course, there’s the food (easily some of the best in the world), the culture, the natural landscapes that make me feel like I must be dreaming, and the most kind and generous people I’ve ever met. The one and only Anthony Bourdain, who is very beloved here in Vietnam, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ii4w9NhYSA'>said it better than I ever could.</a> </p>

        <p class='blogsubtitle'>Why Fulbright ETA?</p>

        <p>I found the Fulbright ETA program compelling from the first time I heard of it. The way I see it, the Fulbright ETA program is an amazing opportunity for you to step outside of your comfort zone, live abroad for a year, immerse yourself in a foreign culture, and represent the United States abroad as a cultural ambassador and a friendly face. I’ve always had an interest in teaching and youth, and even though I don’t have a degree in education, it’s a passion I’ve explored through a lot of volunteering experience in the US and abroad. It’s a chance for me to build strong relationships by sharing my language and culture, and joining in the language and culture of Vietnam.</p>


        <p class='blogsubtitle'>Why Fulbright in Vietnam?</p>

        <p>One thing I didn’t realize when applying for Fulbright is how important it is to choose not just a country, but also a Fulbright program that is a good fit for you. So if you’re thinking of applying, here are some of the things I wish someone had told me. Fulbright is run pretty differently around the world; some countries with large programs (like Mexico, South Korea, etc.) have a separate Fulbright commission that is a collaboration between the US and local governments, and handles everything for their Fulbrighters. Vietnam is a post country, meaning that it has no Fulbright commission, and instead both the US government and the US embassy in Vietnam work with Fulbrighters. This means that we got to attend a pre-departure orientation with other post country Fulbrighters going to East Asia and the Pacific, and it also means we have a lot of direct interaction with the US embassy in Vietnam. To my understanding, different commissions and embassies have varying connections with their Fulbrighters, and some are more efficient than others. I can’t speak for any of the other countries, but I can say that I’m endlessly glad to be part of the Fulbright program in Vietnam. The US embassy in Vietnam is full of some of the greatest people, who maintain strong connections with us and advocate for us tirelessly to our host institutions. I feel so supported by the staff in the US embassy, and that’s a big reason why I would recommend Fulbright in Vietnam.</p>

        <p>Another perk to being a Fulbright ETA in Vietnam was our one-month orientation in Hanoi at the beginning of the grant. We spent a month getting to know Vietnam, listening to experts on Vietnamese history and culture, taking Vietnamese language classes, taking classes on teaching English as a foreign language, and teaching practice lessons at high schools and colleges near Hanoi. I made some really close friendships with the people in my cohort, and I started at my school feeling so much more confident about teaching and navigating the country by myself. That leads into another factor to consider: cohort size. There are usually between 15-19 grants for ETAs in Vietnam (my cohort has 19 people). This size has been amazing for me, because we’ve all gotten really close in a small-ish group. We’re all placed in different provinces across the country, but most of us aren’t too far from another ETA and can easily meet up somewhere on the weekends. Some Fulbright programs have only a couple ETAs, and some have hundreds. This is only one of many important considerations, but I think my close friendships within my cohort will have a pretty big impact on my happiness while I’m living in Vietnam.</p>


        <p class='blogsubtitle'>Being an American in Vietnam</p>

        <p>There’s something incredible about being an American in Vietnam. As I’ve traveled around the world, I’ve gotten pretty accustomed to my presence being unwanted in other countries. Locals from countries that are overrun by tourists are often annoyed by any foreigners, and Americans (quite fairly) have a pretty bad reputation in the world. Sometimes I feel like I have to prove people wrong, or go out of my way to get a smile instead of a dirty look, or avoid trying to speak the local language for fear that I’ll be laughed at. I have never felt like this in Vietnam. My favorite thing about being an American in Vietnam is that my presence here is met with curiosity, friendliness, or at worst, indifference. I feel welcomed here in a way that I’ve never felt in another country. Vietnam is changing quickly and a young population is looking to the outside world more and more. People in Vietnam are so proud of their country, culture, and history. So many of the people I meet here tell me that they love being able to share it with me, and I feel so grateful to be able to take part in that.</p>

        <p>As Americans, we usually hear of Vietnam only as a place of violent war and Communism. It’s easy to assume that after the atrocities we committed in Vietnam only a few decades ago, hatred towards Americans would abound. But much to my surprise, the US is viewed incredibly well in Vietnam, with somewhere around 90% favorability (I can’t remember the exact number, but we learned this stat from the US embassy). For the most part, young Vietnamese people view the war as something that happened in the distant past, and in a country that has changed so much so quickly, it’s not hard to imagine why. Of course, that doesn’t mean the war is erased from Vietnam. Generational trauma still exists, and people are still physically, mentally, and otherwise affected by the actions of the US in Vietnam. At times, that can make my American friends and I feel unsure of our presence in Vietnam—shouldn’t it feel weird that we moved to a country that our country so recently did such evil things to, and here we are, teaching about English and America, and kind of pretending it never happened? </p>

        <p>But when I think of my students, who are smart, passionate, and ambitious, and who think critically about the United States constantly, I’m reminded why I’m here. In a globalized world, my students will get into better universities, have better job prospects, and be better off if they speak English. They’re excited about learning English, and many of them are also learning French, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Russian, because they’re passionate about the doors opened up by foreign languages. So I’m here, as an American teaching English in Vietnam, for them.</p>
