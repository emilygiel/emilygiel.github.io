        <p class='blogtitle'>What My Life Here Looks Like</p>

<p>Most mornings, I wake up to a blaring school bell. The bell is scheduled for 6 am each morning, but I got in the habit of checking the actual time every morning out of curiosity. Sometimes it goes off at 6:02, sometimes at 6:09, sometimes at 5:58. The worst is when it goes off closer to 5:50, which feels like a cruel universe deciding I should be 10 minutes more sleep-deprived that day. It’s always unpredictable- I’m assuming the alarm isn’t automatic but relies on a person to press it at roughly 6 every morning. And I said the alarm instead of the bell on purpose—because it really sounds more like an American fire alarm. Some mornings I roll back over and try to get another 20-30 minutes of sleep, and some mornings I give in and roll right out of bed. I’ve never been much of a morning person, but aside from the initial 30 seconds of panic as my nervous system realizes that no, the dorm is not on fire, I actually don’t mind being up so early. </p>

<p>I get ready and walk across the school grounds of Chuyên Vĩnh Phúc (Vĩnh Phúc High School for Gifted Students) to my classroom, which I am so lucky to get all to myself, at least for now. Students in PE class wave at me as I pass the basketball court, and I avoid the eyes of the PE teacher who loudly declared his love for me in front of his students on my first day at school. (“He just got a divorce. Please don’t give him your phone number,” an English teacher had told me.) Students walking around the grounds give me a nod and a “Hello, teacher!” I smile at them and say “Chào các em!” and sometimes they giggle and give me a “Chào cô ạ!” in return. In the sea of students I usually see a lot of familiar students. If I’m lucky I’ll even remember some familiar names. I have close to 500 students, so I’ve been trying my best to memorize everyone’s names; I had all my students make nametags to use in my classroom, I repeat their names every time they talk in class, and I practice the tones on common Vietnamese names in my Vietnamese lessons, but sometimes that still doesn’t cut it. (“There’s a girl in my class named Ngọc. Yesterday, you called her Ngốc. That means ‘stupid,’” one of my students told me last week.)</p>


<p>I walk up the stairs and unlock my classroom. It’s pretty large, with giant immovable desks and stools that love to clang and break in class. I turn on all six of the enormous overhead fans, reboot the computer, and set out the pile of nametags for my first class to grab as they walk in. I usually teach four 45-minute classes during the morning session, which goes from 7 am-11:10 am. I teach ten 12th grade classes and three 11th grade classes once each week. My students are really incredible, and I’m constantly feeling lucky to have them. They’re smart, talented, hilarious, respectful, and enthusiastic. Despite the fact that they are literally always studying and have class Monday-Saturday (some of them even go to “extra school” on Sundays too), they’re excited to be here and ready to learn. Chuyên Vĩnh Phúc (CVP) is the gifted high school for the entire province of Vĩnh Phúc, so while some of my students are from Vĩnh Yên city where the school is located, many of them come from smaller and more rural districts around the province. Especially for these students, who live in the dorms’ crowded rooms full of teenagers, it’s a huge deal that they got the test scores to come to CVP. Their families invest a lot into them being here, so they take their education seriously, but they’re still full of personality and, unfathomably, often full of energy as well.</p>

<p>Eventually, my students start to trickle in, with a “Good morning, teacher” from each of them (and a shy “May I enter, teacher?” outside the door if they show up late). I’m officially an English speaking and listening teacher, so supposed to be more or less teaching the units in the textbook, but I’m free to come up with whatever activities that I want within the same general topic. Some of these units are more fun than others. For example, the 12th grade unit for my third week teaching is urbanization, and the 11th grade unit is love and relationships. Guess which one makes for more fun lesson plans? But I can still try to find a way to make them all interesting. I’ve only got 45 minutes, so that usually leaves room for about two activities and some class conversations. For my urbanization lesson this week, we’re starting with competitive telephone (a total ESL teacher cop-out) using urbanization vocab, idioms, and sentences. The students go crazy for this, with lots of panicked yelling and a fair bit of cheating (I’ve had to start assigning one student in each class to help me police for cheaters). Then, I go over the vocab and the new idioms. We talk about urbanization and cities, and I have them discuss in their tables the advantages of living in a big city, then the disadvantages of living in a big city, then we regroup and discuss them as a class. Then I have them discuss what their ideal city would be like, and each table creates a map of their dream city. Meanwhile, in my 11th grade classes, the theme of the telephone game is love and relationship idioms. We talk a bit about dating culture in the US and Vietnam, and then they play a mock speed dating game, which embarrasses them to no end and is totally hilarious.</p>

<p>All of my classes are full of amazing students, but each class is so different. At CVP, based on their entrance exams, the students can choose their major. I teach the 11th and 12th grade English major classes, which have practically fluent English speakers who are excited to learn, although sometimes they stress a little too much about being perfect. My other classes vary wildly in English skills: some of them are pretty advanced, and others are much lower-level. But every class is excited to learn—sometimes the lower level classes are even more fun, because they are less embarrassed by their mistakes and more willing to creatively use their smaller vocabularies to be hilarious and silly. Sometimes it’s difficult to adjust my teaching as I go based on what it seems like they understand, but it’s always a fun challenge.</p>

<p>Morning classes end around 11:10, but never precisely on time. Remember that school bell timed by human error I mentioned earlier? It also makes it pretty difficult to time my lessons: sometimes at the end of a class scheduled to end at 7:45 the bell will ring at 7:47, and sometimes at 7:52. When my classes end between 11:10-11:17, if I’m lucky I’ll head off to lunch plans with a student. I meet them at the school gate with my electric bike, or I hop on one of theirs, and an intimidating e-biker gang of teenage Vietnamese girls with their American teacher in tow scoot off to find lunch. So far, my students have taken me to get bún chả (a life-changing northern Vietnamese specialty of noodle soup and grilled pork), ốc (snails), beefsteak, cơm rang gà (fried chicken with fried rice), and bún cua (like bún chả but with crab). After we eat, we almost always go to get chè (Vietnamese dessert) or trà chanh (lemon tea) before they drop me back off at school.</p>

        <div class="caption"><img src = "pho.jpeg" alt = "The phở at my favorite shop"  height = 400 class = "centered"><br>The phở at my favorite shop</div>

<p>On my days without lunch plans, I usually bike to the phở and cơm rang shop down the street where I’ve quickly become a regular. Over the many times I’ve been there, I’ve developed a rapport with the family who owns the shop, Chị Phương, Chị Đan, and Anh Quân. They happily greet me when I walk in and then speak to me in rapid-fire Vietnamese, and if I’m lucky I’ll understand one or two words and give a broken half-response. Their favorite topics of conversation are whether or not I am married, why I haven’t finished my food yet, how beautiful my electric bike is, whether I am going to get married soon, and why I come there so often. In all seriousness, it’s kind of crazy how much this small relationship has grown to mean to me. They really don’t have to be as friendly to me as they are. They could easily give me my food and take my money, as most people probably would in the US. They could get frustrated by my inability to speak Vietnamese and failure to understand all their questions. But they are excited to see me every time, and they continue trying to speak to me despite my atrocious language skills. The absolute smallest gestures of kindness and friendliness grow to mean the world to you when you’re alone in an unfamiliar place, and I’m grateful to them for giving me that.</p>

<p>After I get lunch, I usually retreat to a café to plan lessons, journal, write a blog post, or attempt to make this website a little less ugly (it’s a work in progress). There’s no shortage of cute cafes or strong WiFi in Vĩnh Yên. Afterwards, I head back to my dorm at school. One or two times a week, I teach the national team, a group of the top 40 English majors at CVP who are preparing to take a rigorous English exam for the chance at scholarships and university admission. They are awesome to teach—I’ve been able to teach about social media’s impact on mental health, climate activism, and cultural norms. They’re very serious about learning (the stakes are high!), and they put so much effort into the class, which is always gratifying. If I’m not teaching the national team, I have Vietnamese lessons with two of the English teachers at my school, that consist of me attempting to learn new phrases and invariably making every student who walks by and hears my pronunciation crack up laughing. Otherwise, I head to the gym before going back to my dorm, cooking dinner, trying to call someone from home, and going to bed.</p>

<p>I’ve only been in Vĩnh Yên for just over a month, but it’s crazy how quickly I’ve developed a routine and learned to feel comfortable here. Honestly despite some occasional culture shock I’m adapting much better than I ever thought I could. There are some challenges, but I’m grateful that I have a place in this community.</p>
