        <p class='blogtitle'>On Vulnerability in a Foreign Place</p>

<p>When you are one of the only foreigners living in a foreign city whose language you don’t speak, you have no choice but to learn to trust. You open yourself up to a city and culture you can never truly understand, and you trust the people who live there to embrace you and take care of you. You trust that the new people you meet are looking out for you, interpreting the confusing new world for you. You trust that they can anticipate the needs you wouldn’t even know to anticipate and answer the questions you wouldn’t even know to ask. You trust that when your language skills falter, the meager smiles and body language you offer to strangers will be enough to convey all the meaning you are wordless to express in their language. You trust strangers when they tell you to follow them, wait here, get on this motorbike, eat this. Sometimes you need to take a leap of faith over the language barrier that stands between you and everyone you encounter, and trust the intentions of strangers even when they can’t be communicated.</p>

<p>You trust the world not to laugh (or at least to only laugh with you) when you make mistakes, fall off your bike, pay with the wrong bills, ask silly questions, dip the wrong food in the wrong type of fish sauce at dinner, wear your áo dài the wrong way, use an inappropriate pronoun when you have to choose the most respectful of nine options, or otherwise lose face. You trust them with your most vulnerable self, who knows nothing and does everything wrong, but continues to learn more and get just a little bit better each day. You trust the city to be there for you as if you were one of their own, even if you can never repay the favor.</p>

<p>You trust yourself to keep getting up each time you fall. You trust yourself to have the motivation to get out of your room each morning and face a world you don’t understand. You trust yourself to smile at all the people who stare at you, even on the days when the stares following you just make you want to shrink back into your room. And you trust the people who stare at you to be looking in kind curiosity, with the best of intentions. You trust yourself to keep in touch with your mental health, to take care of yourself. You trust yourself to open up to the world and grow with it as it challenges you every day. You trust yourself to make an effort every day to feel at home in a country that is not your own.</p>

<p>Each day in Vietnam, I can feel myself growing a little more. I came into this year terrified by the fact that to live here alone, I would need to be constantly vulnerable. After some scary experiences traveling in the past, I’d grown a thick skin and a hesitance to trust the intentions of strangers. Relying only on myself and my own gut instincts was the safest way to get by. But I wanted more out of this year, and I knew there was no way to get that by closing myself off. As I’ve stumbled through my time here, I’m becoming more vulnerable, more fearless, and more trusting. </p>

<p>Vietnam constantly surprises me by how well it takes care of me. A few weeks ago, I decided to eat lunch in a park alone. I bought bánh mì, sat on a bench, and ate while reading, unaware that I was occupying the usual picnic spot of the produce and flower vendors in town. When a group of women wearing Vietnamese conical hats and carrying baskets of goods came towards the park on their bicycles to set up their tarp, they were pleasantly perplexed to see me there. They insisted that I sit with them, fed me chunks of mía (sugarcane) and taught me how to chew and spit it out, offered me yogurt, smiled at my broken Vietnamese as I answered their questions about my age, nationality, and job, and showered me with compliments about how xinh đẹp (beautiful) I was. As happens so often, I was embraced with kindness, hospitality, and grace by absolute strangers.</p>

 <p>It’s easy to trust when the people here are always looking out for me, making sure I’m eating all my meals, making sure I’m not too lonely, even making sure I know how to use chopsticks before each and every meal. I’m lucky to be in a country that makes vulnerability so easy.</p>
