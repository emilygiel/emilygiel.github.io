                <p>At HBO, I was responsible for analyzing streaming data to create <span class="emphasis">post-season 
                and post-premiere viewership reports</span>. I used streaming data, media data, web traffic data, 
                and social listening data in <span class="emphasis">cross-channel analyses</span>. I wrote <span class="emphasis">SQL queries</span> to analyze dense AWS 
                databases on Redshift and Athena, and used Tableau and Excel to create <span class="emphasis">data visualizations</span>. My
                reports were sent to the CMO and top executives to inform marketing decisions.</p>

                <p>I was part of VICE’s digital agency, Carrot Creative. I conducted <span class="emphasis">social listening research</span> for 
                clients like Unilever, Pepsi, Victoria’s Secret, Carl’s Jr., and lululemon. I analyzed audience 
                conversation on social media using Crimson Hexagon, Synthesio, and Affinio, and found insights to help 
                brands better understand their audiences. I created reports with <span class="emphasis">data-driven marketing recommendations</span>,
                and presented to Victoria’s Secret and Pepsi.</p>

                <p>I worked with Tailwind’s clients to enhance <span class="emphasis">lead generation through paid media campaigns</span>. I built out 
                <span class="emphasis">search campaigns</span> on Google and Bing and wrote thousands of keywords and dozens of ads. I created paid social 
                ads on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. I worked directly with clients to customize <span class="emphasis">paid media strategies</span>. 
                I also optimized targeting and budgeting to maximize ROI and drive leads.</p>

                <p>I started as an intern at Rille & Co., a small creative agency, and worked my way up to become a marketing 
                coordinator. I created and implemented complete marketing strategies for clients, including <span class="emphasis">social media, web,
                CRM, event, and branding strategies</span>. I created and wrote copy for several websites for clients using 
                Squarespace, and grew a client’s co-working space membership by 500%.</p>

                <p>Dropspot was a social media photography app startup I helped start my first year of college. I created a 
                <span class="emphasis">marketing plan, branding, and acquisition strategies</span> for the app, and learned to design marketing strategies 
                from scratch. We were selected as the only undergraduate finalists in ASU’s Igniter Challenge and ASU’s New 
                Venture Challenge. I pitched at ASU’s Igniter Challenge finalist pitch, where we won a $10,000 investment with
                the opportunity to increase to $50,000.</p>
